# TravianHelper
This is a hobby project. My plan is to make a travian helper, which helps users such as building and training.

For now it is only runnable on Microsoft Edge.
Required packages:

python3 and selenium

How to run (on Linux):

`cd project_folder`

`python3 main.py`

After this, you should be able to see a GUI which asks for login_credentials for travian kingdoms.

### There are lots of functions not implemented yet, it's still in WIP.
